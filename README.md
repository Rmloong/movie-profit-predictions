####This is my README file!

My dream project would be to predict a movie's box office returns before it has released,
based upon available data. There are basically two types of data that I'd be concerned with:
Quantitative and Qualitative. Quantitative data would include the movie's production budget,
marketing budget, time of year, previous box office gross of movies in the same franchise, etc.
Qualitative data would include who the main actors, directors, movie genre, etc.

I do not expect a lot of this data to be publicly available and I doubt movie studios would be
willing to share this data with anyone outside of their organizations, especially those of
a financial nature. However, since is after all a 'dream' project and purely hypothetical in nature.
